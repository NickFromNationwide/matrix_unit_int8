Notes:
For input and output buffers, use variable count, up counters to shift/read edges after we count to n.

MEMORY MAP (8 bit, 65536 byte, Block RAM)
0x0000 - 0x3F: Zero Region (For clear)

REGISTER BUFFERS
A : 8-bit 8x8 buffer 
B : 8-bit 8x8 buffer (represents registers in the SA)
C : 8-bit 8x8 buffer

INPUTS
loa_mtx addr(16 bit)                         : Load vector (8 bytes) into the A buffer and pad rest with 0s
loa_rv addr(16 bit)                          : Load 64 bytes of data into the A buffer
lob addr(16 bit)                             : Load data into B (which are the registers in the array)
loc addr(16 bit)                             : Load data into the C buffer

mca                                          : Move data from C into A

OUTPUTS
sta rows(3 bit) addr(16 bit)                 : Store data from the A buffer to memory
stc rows(3 bit) addr(16 bit)                 : Store data from the C buffer to memory

ARITHMETIC
mul                                          : Perform A x B => C
tps                                          : (OPTIONAL) Perform Transpose(A) => C

smx                                          : Perform (row vector) sigmoid(A[0]) => C[0]
sgd                                          : Perform (row vector) softmax(A[0]) => C[0]
